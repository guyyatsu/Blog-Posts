# The Temple; or The Estate.
Site-87 is the ruins of 2585 Lee's Chepel Road in Greensboro, NC; this
project details the ongoing attempt to reclaim the property for our own
purposes.

## Site-87
So, around 2019-20 when me and my wife first got married we lived with her mom and sister
in this house just barely outside of Greensboro, NC.  Long story short, it ended up burning
down and we all ended up going our separate ways.

Coincidentally the guy who owns it bought it for around ~16k back in the nineties; and the
fire destroying the dwelling conveniently wiped out any appreciation that asset may have
accrued since then.

Basically, what I'm saying is the lot's back at the sweet-sweet going price of ~16k.


## Operation: Resurrection

### Base Camp
Between the front court yard and the back paddock there is a copse of trees with the overgrown
remains of the path between the two sections.  As it stands it's the ideal spot to set up basecamp
after the initial touch-down, due to the protected and secluded nature of the site.  A generously
sized tent with entrances on both sides will serve our purposes, as well as acting as a sort of gate-way.

#### May 5, 2023; Initial Touchdown
As of today we're making the jump towards self sufficiency.  We have a tent, refrigerator, battery, and solar panels
coming in the mail __*today*__, and it's the first day of the weekend.  I'm hungry; I've been eating nothing but
Sheetz MTO for weeks.  I'm tired; I've been sleeping crooked in the unlevel bed of the van for even longer.  After
weeks of travel, I've finally reached my destination; the ruins with the vomitorium facing north in the clearing besides
the ley-line bordering the field.

We're just testing out the new tech while we're in Madison for now, but the intention is to have camp made by the end
of the night and hopefully hae our battery filled by then too so we can get the projector running.  I'm thinking anime
movie-night.

As an aside, I'm also downloading Jojo's Bizzarre Adventure: Golden Wind as we speak.


### Long-Range Radio Communication
Consumer-Grade radio communications have come a long way in the ~60 years they've been around.  Thanks to the
[TP-Link CPE-710](https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/outdoor-radio/cpe710/) and 5G WiFi,
it's possible to make a reliable wireless connection at a distance of over 20 miles.

Short geography lesson for you; Madison, NC, which is where my main server is located, sits in the foothills
on the border between North Carolina and Virginia. Site-87 is located exactly 20 miles South by Southeast of
Madison in Browns Summit, NC, just outside of Greensboro.  

With a range of ~23km, or a safe 20 miles, it should be possible to establish a link between Lab-93 and Site-87
and thusly bypass the need to purchase another internet connection while being conducive to our credibility as
a ```service provider```.
