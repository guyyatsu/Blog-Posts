# A Far-Away Remote System; Uninhabited by Man.
Site-87 is the ruins of 2585 Lee's Chepel Road in Greensboro, NC; this project details the ongoing attempt at reclaiming
the property to our own ends.

Building from the ground up using our knowledge of electrical engineering, automation, and computer networking to
establish a remote foothold to habitate as a scientific expansion of the Lab-93 server system.

The first phase of the operation involves setting up a base-line level of habitability in order to confortably support
a single individual long-term, preferably indefinitely.

This basecamp will serve as the forward base of operations for our efforts, and it's convenient to our J1 initiative.
As this is a stealth operation, our biggest barrier to success is `Nosy Neighbors` and `Pesky Pigs` investigating our
proceedings.

```
Luckily, that has come to pass and the camp made it through okay.
We had cops and*neighbors come through, wondering what we were up to,
but were able to convince the cops we had permission to be here and
the neighbors were un-concerned so long as we weren't damaging the
property.  No further incidents have been reported.
```


## Phase One
The tent is currently situated on the front strip of the yard facing the road from the house; between the house itself
and the cedar tree that marks the grove between the yard and the clearing.  With how short the powerlines coming off
the solar panels are, this seemed like the best option at the time.

This has proven to be the incorrect assumption as it has the tent facing directly East with no protection from the Sun
at all, making sleeping during the day practically impossible.  It also has the added drawback of bringing the overall
temperature inside the tent practically unlivable.

The new thought is to place the tent within the grove, so as to
  - A. Shield the camp from the Sun, and  
  - B. Hide the camp from any would-be snoops.

Even with current wire-length requirements, irrespective of future extensions, the grove is a suitable position also
because of it's unique `gateway` like function in relation to the yard as a whole.

The campsite has to be able to accomodate an individual and all of their life-support systems, as well as the tools for
them to do their job as defined by the Phase One equipment list.

Phase One is currently in progress, so this description stands as a floating basket-list of features expected to be
completed in order to progress to Phase Two.  These milestones represent work to be done on the site that can be done
with the current list of equipment.

### Project List

  ---
  - [ ] `Clear Driveway`:
    The entire _house side_ of the property is absolutely littered with trash, and so is the entire _house itself_.
    It's unsightly, and it severely limits our landing capabilities over there.  Once the shuttle has been completely
    unloaded it needs to be re-fitted for off-loading all the garbage it can carry; this includes:

      ---
      - [ ] Finding a local dump & inquiring into their rates.
      - [ ] Protecting the shuttle's cargo bay from the trash by putting down a tarp.
      - [ ] Loading the debris onto the shuttle and taking it to the dump.
      
      ---

    Once this has been completed we can begin working on the `Phase Two: Radio Networking` project item.

  ---
  - [ ] `Re-Build Fire Pit`:
    Whoever's been here has a pretty dangerous setup going on for their fire pit; which is to say the lack of one, and
    the fact that it's directly underneath a live tree.  From the sorch marks of previous fires, you can tell that
    there's been controlled burns straight on the ground; since then the grass has overtaken the spot, making it ripe
    for an __*uncontrolled*__ burn.  For this project, we define the following tasks:

      ---
      - [ ] Clear up back-yard debris, same way as the drive way.  Set aside what we can burn.
      - [ ] Cut back the bush that's grown in to the burn area; strip it bare.
      - [ ] Relocate stones from the dried-out pond to an area away from trees in a circle.
      - [ ] Dig out about **`3"`** to **`5"`** from the area of the circle and pile up around stones.

      ---

    With these tasks out of the way we can commence operation on `Phase Two: Spacial Expansion`.

  ---
  - [ ] `Raze Front-Yard Weeds`:
    There's a bunch of **`5'`** tall weeds growing between the front path and the road; when the space would be perfect
    for placing the solar array.  Using the machete to cut the weeds down to the earth, we can then use the remains as
    the beginnings of a compost pile, for any potential gardening.  __*Also*__, there is the recent incident of a peach
    tree falling across the path, so the tree needs to be chopped up as well. Key milestones for this project are:

      ---
      - [ ] Remove twigs and branches from dried-out pond; possibly lay tarp over the indentation.
      - [ ] Chop weeds by hacking away at the ground until sufficient clearance has been made.
      - [ ] Gather remains of weeds and collect in cleared out pond; rename pond to compost pile.
      - [ ] Chop remains of peach tree and remove from path; rake up any fallen peaches. Save wood inside ruins.

      ---

    After completion of this set of tasks we can look into expanding our solar capabilities, or even possibly starting
    a garden to sustain ourselves.
    

### Equipment List

  - `60w Solar Panels`:
    We have two portable **`60w`** solar panels running in series to produce a steady **`45w`** in full sun; which is
    enough to run everything individually, but definitely not enough to sustain the refrigerator indefinitely and have
    access to our other equipment.  I suspect that with a parallel connector we can get production up to double the
    current rate.

  - `200w Power Station`:
    Currently, our battery capacity is fairly weak; even the laptop makes quick work of it once the sun goes down. As
    it stands we have a single modular power-station rated at **`3.3a`** for **`200w`**; with two more of these we
    should be able to support all the rest of the electrical equipment described in the list.
    
  - `Mini Fridge`:
    Our _electronic cooler_ pulls about the same draw as the cyberdeck does on full load; pretty safe to say this is
    the most **power hungry** device on the list, weighing in at a fair **`45w`**-**`50w`** on standby.  On average,
    we should be producing __*`at least`*__ three times the average load of our largest consumer, with a capacity to
    maintain peak load for two days of no production.

  - `Rice Cooker`:
    A staple of hikikomori cooking utensils, the rice cooker is a must-have for extended periods of survivalist living.
    You can cook rice, or soup, as well as your egg to perfection in the same vessel with no oversight required.

  - `Egg Steamer`:
    As with the rice cooker, the egg steamer requires practically no oversight to produce the perfect gyukaku dumpling.
    Great for cooking hard-boiled eggs in bulk for making Ajitsuki Tomogi.

  - `Linux Laptop`:
    Also called `The Cyber Deck`, the Linux Laptop is the master-control panel of the entire over-arching Leb-93
    network; it is absolutely crucial to mission success, and as such it must be assumed to always be connected to
    power just like the refrigerator.

  - `4G Wireless Modem`:
    A Netgear Nighthawk loaded up with a SIM card for a home internet connection; paid up for the next year.

  - `Light Projector`:
    To be used on high-production days; the absolute heaviest device on the list, running at around **`75w`** to
    **`100w`**.  Nice to have on warm nights as an unwinder; used for projecting video data as a hard-light on a
    suitable surface.

  - `Motorola Smartphone`:
    A mobile data link used for keeping in loose contact with a network of individuals.  Currently being used in place
    of the wireless modem while it's being fit into the budgeting plan.

  - `Espresso Machine`:
    Second most-important item on the list, after the Linux Laptop.  Invites focus to the job, to maintain high
    productivity and concentration.  Supplemented by a steady supply of beans to be worked into the budget, and a hand
    crank for producing a fine-grain powder suitable for brewing with.

  - `Overhead Lantern`:
    Useful at night when you're trying to see your keyboard, or cook a meal.  Clips on to a hook hanging at the apex
    of the tent's ceiling.


## Phase Two

### Project List

  ---
  - [ ] 'Radio Networking':
    Considering Site-87 sits exactly **`20mi`** from the site of Lab-93 and rests at favorable elevation comparably to
    make a good radio connection, it's worth a shot to attempt a long distance internet connection using a
    [TP-Link CPE-710](https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/outdoor-radio/cpe710/) directional 5G antenna to
    directly interface with the Lab-93 network through our own infrastructure; making this an intranet operation.

  ---
  - [ ] `Spacial Expansion`:
    In an effort to make the camp more `homey` we set up an outdoor theatre with the projector and sound system.
